lib-ecma

This is an effort to create a client-side ecma javascript demo which can connect
to rtServiceManager on an stb, without the use of Node.js, and using only WebSockets.

Files from the 'lib' folder were copied to 'lib-ecma', and Node.js references were removed.
A new RTRemoteWebSocketTransport transport was create to replace RTRemoteTCPTransport.  

Since WebSockets doesn't support multicast, rtRemoteMulticastResolver was replaced with a new 
tRemoteUnicastResolver, which connects to the rtunicastresolverd deamon running on the stb. 

The rtunicastresolverd daemon will proxy the web socket request to a multicast request on the stb
and relay a websocket endpoint back to the client.  From there the client will use a WebSocket
to connect to the server directly.
